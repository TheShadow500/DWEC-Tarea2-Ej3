Create a web page that calculates the average of 'n' numbers.

The number 'n' should be entered using an input field.
Upon entering the value of 'n', generate 'n' text fields for entering the values.
Include a button labeled "Calculate Rounded Average" that, when clicked, displays the rounded average of the entered numbers.
Errors should be managed gracefully.
